# Systolic Matrix Multiplier
Xilinx HLS design files for a Systolic Matrix Multiplier

Systolic arrays are a class of simple, elegant and energy-efficient architectures for accelerating general matrix multiplication (GEMM) operations in hardware. They appear in many academic and commercial DNN accelerator designs. The case of matrix-matrix multiplication also encompasses the degenerate cases of matrix-vector and vector-vector products, where one or both operand matrices have dimension equal to one.
